# Instructions

Each assignment has an existing number of unit tests. Some are passing and other are disabled. Your task is to implement the functionality using the test harness as a guide. Once all tests are passing for a given challenge, identify the time and space complexity of the solution. Can the solution be improved? 

# Homework

For these exercises, the character sets are assumed to be ASCII. 

## Is Unique

Given a string, implement the method to determine if the string contains all unique characters. This method will be case sensitive. For example, "Aa" is unique but "AA" is not unique. 

**Extra Credit:**
* Create a second method that ignores character case and spaces.
* Implement the algorithm without the help of String utility classes.
* Implement without using additional data structures. 

## Check Permutation

Given two strings, write a method that checks if one is a permutation of another.

**Extra Credit:**
* Create two different algorithms checking for permutations.
* Create a second check permutation method that ignores case. (Do not use a flag parameter to change the behavior of the existing method.)
