# String Properties

## Is Unique

Implement a function that determines if a String contains unique characters. This function
will be sensitive to case and special characters. For example, "Aa" is unique but "AA" is
unique. 

### Challenges

* Create a second method that ignores character case and spaces.
* Implement the algorithm without the help of String utility classes.
* Implement without using other second data structures.
