# Instructions

Each exercise has an existing number of unit tests, some of which are passing and others are disabled. Your task is to implement the functionality using the test harness as a guide. Once all tests are passing for a given exercise, review the solution for improvements using these questions as a guide:

1. What will improved readability of the code?
2. What is the time complexity and can it be improved?
3. What is the space complexity and can it be improved?
4. What are the trad-offs between time and space complexity?

To begin an exercise, open the corresponding test class and run the tests. Implement the failing tests for each exercise.
